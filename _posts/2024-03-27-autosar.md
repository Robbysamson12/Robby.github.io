## The best AUTOSAR course in Chennai: A Comprehensive Guide 2024.

Many courses that have been the best to date. AUTOSAR embedded courses are one of them used in the automobile industry. The future is in your hands as  We are excited to offer “ The Best AutoSAR Course: A Comprehensive Guide 2024”. This blog gives a complete idea of AUTOSAR’s architecture, specifications, and its key components. 
Automotive Open Systems Architecture (AUTOSAR) is a development partnership of automotive interested parties founded in 2003. It is focused on creating and establishing an open and standardized software architecture for the automotive electronic control units (ECUs). Goals include scalability to different vehicle and platform variants, transferability of software, consideration of availability and safety requirements, collaboration between various partners, sustainable use of natural resources, and maintainability during the product life cycle. 

## What is AUTOSAR? 
AUTOSAR is a software platform layered with software architecture defined by AUTOSAR used for deeply embedded systems and application software with high requirements for predictability, safety, security, and responsiveness. AUTOSAR  distinguishes at the highest level of abstraction between three software layers running a microcontroller. i.e. Application, “Runtime environment(RTE)”, and Basic software(BSW), and provides a modular and scalable approach to software development

## AUTOSAR core set of specifications
AUTOSAR's core set of specifications consists of a standardized framework designed to facilitate the development of automotive systems. Automotive manufacturers and suppliers can streamline development processes, enhance software reusability, and achieve greater flexibility in integrating new functionalities. This approach made collaboration with the automobile industry and enabled the creation of complex, feature-rich vehicle software while maintaining high levels of reliability and maintainability 

## The key components of AUTOSAR 
AUTOSAR components are reusable of the AUTOSAR software. It is a software component that encapsulates one or more algorithms and communicates through well-defined ports. For example, a throttle application might include AUTOSAR software components that represent the sensors for throttle and acceleration for pedal sensors, a throttle position a monitor, a controller, an actuator purpose 
The software components present are:
Two throttle position sensors 
Throttle position monitor 
Acceleration pedal position sensor 
Controller
Throttle position actuator 

## The significance of Autosar architecture
AUTOSAR uses a three-layer architecture
Basic Software: 
Standardized software modules (mostly) with no explicit automotive job but offer services needed to run the functional part of the upper software layer 
Run Time Environment (RTE) : 
The Middle portion had been abstracted from the network topology for the inter and intra-ECU information exchange between the application software components.
Application Layer : 
Application software components that interact with run time environment 

## AUTOSAR is designed for reusability:
AUTOSAR is reusable and also enables the reuse of software components across different vehicle models and manufacturers. This reduces the time and cost required to develop new software components from scratch.

## The AUTOSAR PDU( Protocol Data Unit):
To create the level of abstraction for signals from the physical entity of ECU AUTOSAR  introduced the concept of AUTOSAR PDU(AUTOSAR Protocol Data Unit). AUTOSAR signals are no longer they are directly mapped to a transmission frame but to technology, agnostic PDUs transported within the frames these PDU can travel across the entire vehicle networks independent of the underlying transmission technologies. For example, if PDUs with the signals resulting from some push button or switches can travel across multiple networks to a central computing platform where necessary actions will be determined
